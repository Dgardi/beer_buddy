# Beer Buddy! üçª
Breweries are America's cornerstone for good times and good drinks. Everyone has their favorite local brewery, but sometimes it's nice to branch out. Have you ever wished for a simple way to find all the breweries in your local area, or even in a city you're about to visit? What about a convenient way to ~~trash terrible breweries~~ write reviews about your experiences at the breweries you visit?

If so, then Beer Buddy is about to be your ***best friend***!

# Features
With Beer Buddy, you can:
- Create a user profile that houses all of your personal entries.
- Make a list of breweries you've vistied.
- Rate and write reviews about any brewery you've been to so you can remember the good times (or not so good times).
- Search any US city for a list of breweries in that area. The results contain the name of the brewery, contact information, and their address.
- Get random Chuck Norris quotes!

# Website Content
## Home
Beer Buddy's homepage features a slideshow of photo's to set the mood. The "About Me" section below gives a little information about the creators of Beer Buddy. We wanted to make sure that users know we're real people and we care about the success of local breweries around the country. Our mission is to keep local breweries on peoples' minds.

We also felt that having a little Chuck Norris sprinkled in there would unexpextedly brigthten someone's day.

## My Profile
Users can create a user profile and a log of all their brewery experiences. A quick view list shows every brewery the user has visited as well as a tally.

Clicking any brewery from the quick view list prompts a review where users can rate that brewery out of 5 stars and document their experience.

These submissions are stored in the device's local storage so that users can always reference this imformation on-the-go.

## Brewery Finder
Our team felt that the best way for users to branch out and discover new breweries to support would be to create a page that makes it incredibly simple to find all the breweries located in any US city.

We're Atlanta based, so naturally we decided to have the page default to Atlanta in order to showcase our local businesses.

A map at the top of the page will center over the user's chosen city and place a marker for every brewery that had the lon and lat information available from the Openbrew DB API that we utilized. This gives users an visual idea of how close or how far these breweries are from their location.

Below the map, a list of every brewery populates and has a link to their website, their exact type of brewery, the street address, and a phone number for that business. This way users can connect to that brewery directly from our site if they have any questions or concerns they need to investigate immediately.
